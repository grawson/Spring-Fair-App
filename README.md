# Welcome to Spring Fair!

This app serves as a guide to the Johns Hopkins University Spring Fair; the largest student-run fair in America. The fair brings a weekend full of events, fair food, and music to campus, and is open to the whole community! All graphics are home-made and designed to fit the theme for the year. Check out the demos of the app for each year!
