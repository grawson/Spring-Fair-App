Welcome to Camp Spring Fair!

This app is in the works, and will serve as a guide to the Johns Hopkins University Spring Fair; the largest student-run fair in America. The fair brings a weekend full of events, fair food, and music to campus, and is open to the whole community! This year, the fair will be camp themed...

With this app, users can:

- Sort through the highlights of each day
- Sort through organized lists of all the events and vendors at the fair
- Add events and vendors to a personal "favorites" schedule
- Export events to Apple calendar
- Get directions to the events through Google Maps
